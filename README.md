# Basic API implementation with Rails

The core purpose of this repository is to hold a template of a good rails application. The application will serve as an API.

It will be tested using `rspec` and `wercker`, my favourite continuous integration tool. It will not be deployed anywhere since it is only a template

##Â Testing

To test the application's components:

```
$ bundle exec rspec
```

To test as per the integration tool (may require `env` variables and CLI from [](https://wercker.com)):

```
$ wercker build
```
